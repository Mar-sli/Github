My test project. Using constructors and functions in order to make a more expanded version of Telebook. I would be much obliged for any help I can get. Thanks! :) 


I would appreciate some help with the function I wrote a comment inside of "Source.cpp". 

I would like to type in a function which gather all of the data, and then display it. 
In my program it takes the data and displays it before gathering further data which does not look satisfactory enough to me.

Could you give me a hand?
